### Previously on T-TOA…

We return to the Tomb of Annihilation where our daring heroes were met by 10 menacing minotaur skeletons. But this party wasn’t about to be ribbed apart. With remarkable ease, they dispatched the skeletal foes. Their victory emboldened them as they ventured the Southern corridor reaching an intersection. One way was a small room housing a massive, magical mirror. Aurora’s senses immediately detected its enchantment. Bolgar flexed his muscles in front of the mirror only to vanish into thin air. Filth Bucket stepped forward to peer into the mirror and disappeared as well.

Izzurba sent a message to Bolgar, who responded they are in a fog. Filth Bucket was in a similar predicament, yet they were not in each other’s company. Approaching the mirror, Leopold and Tundra observed its surface ripple, yet they stood unaltered. When Tundra reached out to touch the mirror, she vanished. Leopold, attempting the same, found himself still present.

Intrigued by the mirror’s secrets, Izzurba deduced that the mirror functioned as a magical portal, akin to a prison, with toggles and release mechanisms tied to specific words. “Khomara 1,” Izzurba spoke with anticipation, but the mirror remained inert. A second attempt with “Khomara 2” saw no change. However, when the words “Blackfire 1” were spoken, a Chultan humanoid materialised before the mirror, their well-tailored attire contrasting with their dishevelled expression. They began babbling in Chultan.

Izzurba’s next summons echoed through the chamber: “Blackfire 12.” In response, a colossal mosquito materialised. But Caitlin, ever the swift combatant, dispatched the insect with a well-aimed punch. Meanwhile, Aurora attempted to exert her will over the babbling Chultan, invoking the power of Command. Alas, the Chultan remained unaffected, lost in their own chaotic thoughts.

Undeterred, Izzurba shifted to “Blackfire 11.” The air shimmered, revealing a woman with rich, dark skin. She wore tribal attire adorned with armour plates crafted from giant scorpion. This was Lukanu, the Queen’s former protector before darkness descended. The party engaged her in conversation, their curiosity piqued. Lukanu speculated aloud: Could the Queen herself be trapped within the mirror? Izzurba explained the mirror’s intricate mechanisms and Lukanu, her resolve firm, pledged to aid in freeing the mirror’s prisoners. Perhaps among them lay the missing Queen.

Filth Bucket materialised at the declaration of “Blackfire 10.” As the pronunciation “Blackfire 9” reverberated through the chamber, a four-armed gargoyle materialised, its form imposing in the small space. The party sprang into action, initiative declared. Caitlin, her fists a blur, delivered the finishing blows that shattered the gargoyle’s stony limbs. Lukanu approached the gargoyle, poking at its ancient stonework. Her expression shifted from curiosity to dismay as Aurora recounted the tale of her people’s creation. Lukanu harboured conflicted feelings about this construct and pledged her assistance to the party when the time called for it.

The next invocation, “Blackfire 8,” summoned Pox - a male humanoid who claimed to be tailing yellow-bannered individuals. Pox joined the babbling humanoid in the corridor, preferring to avoid the dangers lurking within the mirror prison. And then, with the words “Blackfire 7,” the mirror released Tlad - an elven figure with ebony skin and shockingly white hair. Tlad readily agreed to aid the party in their mission to empty the mirror prison cells. Yet, Aurora’s keen senses detected an unsettling aura of malevolence surrounding Tlad, while Izzurba discerned his transmutative abilities.

As the command “Blackfire 6” echoed through the chamber, a hulking troll materialised. The party rallied, weapons drawn, and engaged in a fierce battle that left the troll defeated. Next, “Blackfire 5” yielded Bolgar. His arrival injected renewed determination into the party. When “Blackfire 4” resounded, a minotaur named Zaal stepped forth. Lukanu eased tensions by explaining to Zaal that the party were allies, not foes. Zaal, once the Queen’s champion fighter, regarded them warily but eventually accepted their presence.

Curiously, “Blackfire 3” yielded no response from the mirror. The party exchanged puzzled glances, wondering if the mirror’s magic had limits. But then, with the utterance of “Blackfire 2,” a familiar sight unfolded: Tundra, curled up in slumber. Having freed all the mirror prisoners, Izzurba scrutinised the mirror’s attachment to the wall - magical glue held it firmly. Lukanu revealed that the babbling Chultan had lost their sanity and required healing. The party, along with the newly liberated prisoners, stepped through a portal to their camp, seeking respite.

Yet, the night held more surprises. Alone in their tent, Izzurba sensed an unseen presence. Suddenly, an invisible stalker – a being unshackled from the mirror prison - attacked. Izzurba’s scream pierced the night, and the party rushed to their comrade’s aid. Polymorphed into a fearsome T-rex, Izzurba fought back, and the stalker dissipated with a final shriek. The remainder of the night passed uneventfully - a welcome reprieve. And as dawn approached, Izzurba identified the robe from Unkh’s tomb: the elusive Robe of Scintillating Colours.

The morning marked the fifth day since encountering Valindra. Our heroes regrouped, their resolve unwavering, and stepped once more into the tomb’s shadowed depths. This time, they ventured down the opposite hallway to the mirror prison. Before them stood a wall with a painted figure: a humanoid draped in a cloak, its mask adorned with stars. Bolgar pressed their hand against the painted hand. The stone slab yielded, sinking into the floor, revealing chilling murals - a sphere of annihilation consuming hapless victims.

The passageways branched left and right, and an inexplicable dread enveloped Aurora. Tundra led the way south, checking for traps. Amid the labyrinthine corridors, the party stumbled upon a black opal crown (pg 127) atop a pedestal. Izzurba detected no magic but sensed its latent significance. Aurora’s heightened senses detected a foreboding presence to the southeast. Tundra attempted to take both pedestal and crown together, but fate would have other plans. Unable to budge the pedestal, she took the crown alone. As the party pondered their next move, grating stone sounds echoed from the north and west. A chill wind, felt only by Aurora, stirred - an omen of impending evil. Suddenly two figures materialised, embodiments of horror and terror. Despite psychic wounds, the party prevailed.

At the northern door, another painted figure awaited – the same cloaked humanoid with a star-mask, but with its arm amputated. Tundra, indifferent, continued exploring. She encountered a green devil face, its mouth a black void – a sphere of annihilation. Faint whispers teased her furry ears, but she kept her distance. Izzurba, however, leaned closer, hearing demonic voices.

The party’s continued exploration in the passageways led to a grim realisation: the stone slab doors had sealed them within this maze. Desperate, they understood the sacrifice required - a right hand and forearm pressed against the northern door. With unwavering courage, Izzurba stepped forward, taking the hit to unlock their path.

And so, our heroes press onward – mostly armed, dangerous, and bound by destiny. Bolgar’s tendency to be transported to curious places endures. Tundra’s penchant for collecting curiosities persists. Aurora’s evil-sensing gift guides them. Caitlin’s teeth collection remains an enigma. And perhaps, with this eclectic party, Izzurba will attune to the sound of one hand clapping.

Join us as the tomb’s secrets unfold, and peril awaits at every turn.

### Background
Free human (previously thralled by Red Wizards of Thay)

DOB: unknown

(he/him)





The Lightwood Company met Orvex Ocrammas in the lost city of Omu, on Chult. He was partially buried under rubble at a Thayan campsite that had been attacked by the forces of Ras Nsi, and the Fane of the Night Serpent.

Hank used its’ psionic and magic power to remove the thrall brand on Orvex, for which he was incredibly grateful. Orvex assisted the Lightwood Company with some directions and information before being lead to the camp by Guardians’ companion, Crackers.

Orvex is enjoying freedom, having spent his entire life under the evil dominion of the Red Wizards of Thay. He remembers little of his youth, a side effect of the branding process used by the Thayans, but has a strong back, steady hands, and a wealth of human services skills such as tailoring, basic medical care, cleaning, and cooking preparation.

Aboard the ship Orvex has bonded with Filthbucket, one of few among the crew to be able to stand the smell of the kobold, and often assists with kitchen duties. When not working in the kitchen or mess, he is often found on the open decks, idly chatting with Filthbucket (or to him, if the chef is asleep) and enjoying the open view.

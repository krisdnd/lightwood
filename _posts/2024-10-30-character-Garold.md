(he/him)




Adjunct Professor Garistold Pavheydea Hyperion XVI Esq, or ‘Garold’ as known to his crew, is a lost academic, historian, scientician, chemist, psiologist, and general knower of everything. While he has poor memory recall for specific locations or events from his past before meeting the Lightwood Company, he believes he is approximately 1,300 years old, and that he is a loxo.

Ever dropping curious trivia into conversation, and speaking with a blustering noble accent, Garold is very ill at ease in combat, and has appreciated quiet time spent behind the scenes with Hank and other Lightwood Company members. He worships Jove, The Great Knower, and often proclaims ‘By Jove!’ when overly enthusiastic about something.

Garold weighs nearly a ton, is over eight feet tall, and five feet across the shoulders. He carries no weapons, preferring a sharp mind and a witty retort to any violence.

He sleeps standing up, and is often found in the warmth of the afternoon sun, snoring softly to himself and immovable as a rock. When in his element, however, he is a bustling, energetic individual, with a touch of clumsiness that seems more related to the smaller size of everything compared to his large frame, rather than of any physiological trait.

Aboard the Destiny Garold can be found in his quarters, on deck napping, or in the library lecturing other crew members on completely random topics.

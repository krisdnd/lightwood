### Background
Lightwood Company, Recruit (Joined 1496 DR, not yet inducted)

DOB: 1462 DR

(she/her)




One of the last members to be recruited prior to the destruction of the company house of the Lightwood Co., Curly is an accomplished druid and herbalist.

A halfling, Curly was orphaned by bandits at a young age, and adopted by a sacrosanct druid circle whose identity she declines, politely, to share. She began adventuring the â€˜realms around 1480 DR, but is quiet and reserved, and declines to discuss her time prior to joining the company.

Curly has not seen any combat since joining the company, but has served as an apprentice alchemist to Hank, and performed some general healing duties amongst the company followers. She displays an in-depth knowledge of the common races and species of Faerun, and has shown a desire to learn more from Hank as it provides opportunity.

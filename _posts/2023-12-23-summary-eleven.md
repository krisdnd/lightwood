### Previously on T-TOA…
We rejoined our heroes in the hall with the gold snake statue. Guardian stilled the statue as they heard faint muffled noises they discerned to be Aurora. Guardian used their crowbar, Aegis, to move cement pieces around the statue, with the help of Tundra’s strength and Leopold’s mage paw. Aurora below climbed a ladder and opened the grate under the cement pieces and she was met by the rest of the party. Izzurba and Bolgar followed suit. 

All together again, they looted the remnants of the battle in the hall - Guardian grabbed the tooth from the statue and 5000 worth of gold bits from the statue was also gathered. Izzurba had an idea to find the other cubes and asked everyone with a cube to put them in the bag of holding, which they did. Izzurba then casted Locate Object and detected the nearest cube NE within 1000 ft. The party headed east towards the cube but needed to travel through the cathedral where they were met with Dendar snake statues and cultists using a book for necromancy, one a black-robed Yuan-Ti Snekromancer. The party made quick work of defeating them, but Leopold heard more coming from the West, alerting the party. Caitlin said grab the book before disappearing into an alcove. Leopold grabbed the book.

Caitlin suddenly appeared in a room with RasNsi. RasNsi said “Who daressss?”

To which Caitlin shouted “Found RasNsi!”

The party heard Caitlin’s shout which came from where the Snekromancer retreated and they bolted towards Caitlin, entering the RasNsi encounter.
As RasNsi fell, defeated, the hearts of our heroes stopped. They were frozen, unable to move. RasNsi laughed and the blue triangle symbol on the wall glowed into an ‘A.’ Black smoke emanated from RasNsi’s mouth and formed a large figure that waved a hand across the room about the party. They felt their very soul ripped from them and the figure dissipated into the roof. The party members took a moment to steady themselves and noticed they all now not only had a white piece of hair but also felt like something was missing.

The lady snake the party later learned was called Fenthaza, slithered over to RasNsi, spat on him and said “We are free from our bargain.”
She then turned and spoke to the party who told her they were there for the cubes. They made a bargain with Fenthaza – the cubes for them to leave and not return otherwise their livers would be eaten. 

Loot on RasNsi’s body was a magical longsword as detected by Izzurba and some gold pieces.

Meanwhile Bolgar investigated curtains in the room and Guardian searched RasNsi’s throne, although neither found anything. Izzurba did however find a secret door to a room of loot and a Tiefling called Lea. Izzurba also detected 5 magical shields which had an aura of transmutation magic, a stone disc, something magical under a cushion and the 3 puzzle cubes in a pile of gold.

Other loot in the secret room found was a wineflask (100 gp), 150 platinum, 350 gp, 900 sp, a fancy non-magical cloak, a non-magical Harp (250 gp), a magical spellbook Izzurba took, a clay urn with 30 gemstones worth 50 gp inside and a Froghemoth statue with 3 amethyst gemstones (100 gp each gem) in its eyes.

Guardian explored a bit more by walking into the portal Caitlin entered through but ended up back with the others, prompting them to go. The party followed Guardian out of the Fane of the Night Serpent to the afternoon air, all feeling unsettlingly cold.

Uh-oh, looks like RasNsi had the last laugh by having Acererak take our hero’s souls! What are they going to do now? Where did their souls go? Will they get them back? How will they retrieve the 3 remaining cubes? Time is ticking before Valindra sets out her pasty fingers their way! Let’s tune in for the next session!

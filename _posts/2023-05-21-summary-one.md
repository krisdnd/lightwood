### Previously on T-TOA…
Smoke had a dream, tossing a long-forgotten coin. The party continued their trek through the jungle with the help of a certain orb of direction and came to the entrance of Hrakamar, where Frank made the startling announcement that they believed their brother is inside. Musharib suggested finding his fellow community members living at the perimeter for information as to the happenings within before entering. The party do just that and discover that not many of Hrakamar’s original inhabitants remain, replaced by fire newts. Some of which have been using the forge and armoury, located near the ill-fated mines and vault which Musharib instructed to leave locked, although if it’s unlocked when found, Musharib warned of particularly spiritual dwarven relics. Armed with Musharib’s ungrammatical map, the party head to the dwarven ruins. Inside the magma-filled caverns, Frank turns manic and in a desperate attempt to reach his starved sibling, fell into the magma and disappeared. Shocked, the party encounter newts, defeating them effortlessly, before navigating further into the underground ruins. They battled almost 2 dozen fire newts, hell hounds and exploding gremlins. Triumphant and slightly singed, the party is left pondering which path to follow. This session, will they go East? Will they go West? Will they find Hank? Where did Filth Bucket go? Come, gaze upon our heroes as they explore the fiery bowels of Hrakamar

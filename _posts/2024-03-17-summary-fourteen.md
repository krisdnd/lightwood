### Previously on T-TOA…

Welcome back adventurers! Let’s delve back into the mysterious tomb with our heroes.

After they defeated the mace-wielding monkey, Guardian took the helm of telepathy found in the tomb. A door revealed itself in the shaft and the party continued through it. The wall bore the inscription: “The dead abhor sunlight. Only a jewel can tame the frog. Bow as the dead God intoned. Into a darkness descend.”

As the party approached a massive Southern door, the air reeked of rotting flesh and demonic faces adorned the walls. Groans emanated from behind the door with three holes at head height and zombie heads snapped out from them. Bolgar wielded divine chain axes, but the zombies and door remained immovable. Bolgar and Tundra continued an array of attacks on the zombies, Tundra noticing that as they died, they were pulled back into the darkness, causing the door to shudder.

Guardian dispatched the last zombie and the door ascended, revealing another tomb. Bronze statues of Chultan warriors flanked a shield, while cauldrons and an Iblis/Papazotl statue filled the room. Aurora (Moa), Bolgar (Obo-laka) and Tundra (Wongo) took their positions in the room and Trent read the shield’s inscription: “Bow before no one.” Izzurba bowed to the faceless statue, causing the cauldron to boil momentarily. Nothing else happened until the party spotted the sarcophagus in the centre, seemingly holding treasure. Filth Bucket donned the golden torque, enchanted by its allure. Trent’s detect magic revealed an amulet’s magical properties. Guardian took the amulet and Papazotl’s shadows converged on the walls. Resisting the deity’s influence, Guardian wore the amulet and with the help of Papazotl, revealed a secret door.

With determination, Guardian opened the door revealing a tunnel. Our heroes ventured through, discovering an alcove with a dusty bottle resting on a table. Trent heard a voice emanating from the bottle and expressed their dislike for it. The party then engaged in a conversation with the mysterious voice through Trent. Just as Trent contemplated acting as the bottled voice asked, it materialised before him, revealing that it was a test. The spirit offered Trent a deal: take 3 witches (lieutenants) alongside Acererack, thus sparing the party from dealing with them directly. Trent informs the party that the ghost will aid their cause.

Guardian’s keen perception detected another secret door at the corridor’s end. Beyond it lay a room saturated with the stench of salt and sulfur. Obo-laka advised Bolgar to add salt to the pentagram in the room. Wongo, ever impulsive, suggested wrecking the pentagram to see what unfolds. Izzurba recognised the ritual – a trap for a demon at the pentagram’s centre. Tundra moved to attack the pentagram, but Izzurba and Bolgar intervene, preventing a potentially calamitous outcome. Aurora sensed demonic energy pacing nearby. The party further investigated the room discovering a wine vat from a small drain grate in the room – Izzurba makes a stopper for it lasting an hour so it didn’t rise and disturb the pentagram. Aurora felt flares and hate, sharing this with the party.

Intrigued, the party headed to the Northern door, which opened into a corridor leading to a green tomb. Guardian leapt into the moth of a green face, disappearing. Inside, Guardian found a casket, and Tundra followed, tumbling across the floor. The sphinxes yawned, releasing locusts that swarm where Tundra landed before returning to their mouths. Bolgar lowered a rope, and Guardian tugged on it, assuring everyone telepathically via Izzurba that all is well.

Leopold descended the rope, followed by Bolgar, and the puzzle continued. The sarcophagus shifted, prompting Bolgar to signal the rest of the party down. Guardian opened the sarcophagus, revealing a horn and refusing I’jin’s spirit.

As the party retraced their steps to the main shaft area, they encountered a cryptic plaque on the wall: “Walk through water with weapon in hand…” The message left them pondering its meaning. Turning their attention to the Western door, they found themselves in a corridor laden with traps. After careful deliberation, Guardian bravely dashed through, reaching the levers. With a decisive pull, Guardian deactivated the traps, allowing the rest of the party safe passage.

Aurora investigated a nearby corpse holding a page of paper – a fallen paladin who shared her faith. Around the paladin’s neck hung a shiny gold chain adorned with their God’s symbol. Driven by a religious impulse, Aurora dons the chain, feeling an intimate connection – it’s as if the chain was crafted specifically for her. The chain burned into her skin, leaving an indelible mark. Suddenly the page was in Aurora’s hands and the party were then able to see the dead elf. Aurora reads the page aloud, realising its significance. This discovery is central to Aurora’s personal quest and the amulet she possesses plays a paramount role. Aurora performs the final rites for the fallen elf, wrapping the body and storing it in Guardian’s bag of holding, during which she notices the elf’s ranking badge and non-magical armour and weapons hint at a high-ranking military background. Izzurba’s magical senses detected an otherworldly glow emanating from Aurora.

The room beyond reeked of wine and a sparking coffin basked in the sunlight filtering through cracks in the roof. Four gargoyle statues protruded from the walls, their presence unsettling. Moa observed that this tomb didn’t align with any known Gods – a peculiar anomaly. Aurora shared this insight with the group.

Undeterred by the oddities, Guardian defied gravity, walking upside down to investigate further. Tundra approached the coffin, but Leo warned of potential traps. Instead, Tundra retrieved a skeleton key, marked with the number ‘V’ in elven runes (indicating -1). She passed it to Izzurba.

Outside, Bolgar heard a mysterious sound, yet nothing is there. But Izzurba discovered a secret door leading to a small room with a bird-bath-like bowl of water. When Izzurba peered into the water’s reflection to collect a sample, it seemed to reveal glimpses through the eyes of possible keys – until an unsettling feeling suggested they are being watched.

Another secret door beckoned, revealing a hallway resonating with mechanical sounds, akin to a forge. Down the passage lay a spiral staircase. Bolgar investigated a workshop to the North. There, three aggressive Tomb dwarves initiated combat, accompanied by rat bone swarms and a Frankenstein-like creature.

What other secrets await within the dark heart of this cryptic tomb, and what role do these keys play? Our adventurers press onward, their fate intertwined with ancient mysteries. Only time will reveal the next chapter in their journey.

### Background
She was born in a tranquil forest to a caring community. Growing up, she enjoyed fighting with the other wood elves - usually the adults.

In her mid-teens, the forest came under attack by orcs. In the chaos of fleeing, Caitlin got separated from the other elves. Wandering a foreign landscape for a few days, Caitlin began to appreciate a life on the road.

Members of Lightwood found her walking alone at night. Caitlin simply said, "The orcs are that way," gestured behind her, and kept walking.

Lightwood took her in, and provided her with food, a place to sleep, and plenty of opportunities for violence.


### Appearance
Caitlin is a wood elf of 29 years, with mid-length white hair, a pale complexion with hints of green and brown, and purple eyes. Her face is usually placid, but very expressive when appropriate. She wears a simple green dress, tied around her hips to assist with easy movement. She's the kind of monk who doesn't wear shoes.

### Possessed by
Unkh (flail snail), neutral alignment, one of the nine trickster gods of Omu in Chult

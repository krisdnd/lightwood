Well look at this assemblage, welcome back to T-TOA, Terry’s Tomb of Anhilation, where the party can expect the unexpected and wherever possible be the unexpected!

We tuned in last session to Izzurba and Trent who during a short midday rest noticed Hank muttering, casting a ritual spell. They observed and the rest of the party feel a weird sense of déjà vu. A portal appeared. Hank stepped back and said “Interesting. Magic that keeps me from entering the shrines, doesn’t keep me from creating a portal to camp.” Hank then entered the portal. Izzurba request’s their familiar, an Octopus to also enter and it disappeared into the portal as well. Tundra sliced the portal with her axe and it remained, unphased by the attack. Octopus returns to Izzurba who said it appears to be safe and the rest of the party proceed to use the portal.

At camp, the party are familiarised with Bulgar, an escapee of the Dark CroWo, who was stewing over failing someone, but was now ready to join in the party’s venture. The party agree to head to the point of interest surrounded by darkness and on arrival there, observe more undead of all races falling into the shadows. It’s not long before they witness a familiar sound, followed by the ghastly sight of the undead T-rex that chased them through the swamplands. Staggering out of the jungle and vomiting zombies, it too succumbed to the dark abyss. The party were gathered at an edge of a cliff 60 ft to the central island when Izzurba suddenly transformed into a giant eagle and shuttled the party members to the island. Hank was last, but levitated over the gap and continued to walk, but not before eyeing Izzurba.

The party came to a shrine overgrown with palms, the entry archway framed with reliefs of coiled serpents. Izzurba as an eagle perched on the archway. Guardian mused that this could be the shrine of Moa. Hank and Trent are on the outskirts of the shrine and Hank touched a hand to Trent bestowing him with the knowledge of Omuan language. Trent proceeded to read the plaque on the shrine:

“Moa teaches us that secrets hide the truth.”

Guardian attempted to walk on the roof leading into the shrine but slipped and fell into a 10 ft pit filled with acidic slime. Bulgar helped Guardian out and Guardian made another attempt to walk across the roof, this time succeeding and walking right up to the pedestal. Guardian notes a mosaic on the floor covered in moss which appears to depict a monkey. Trent enters on the inverse side of the shrine and after removing the moss on the stone read:

“Death rewards a thief deceived. Truth comes from the serpent’s mouth.”

Bulgar inspected the shrine walls uncovering a sliding door that opened to a side room containing a decapitated stone snake and a puzzle key lain on the floor nearby. Meanwhile Guardian investigated the pedestal observing a puzzle key with a snake on it. Guardian then continued to the other side room where they find Octopus stuck to another puzzle cube. It became clear then that there were 3 puzzle pieces, one being the real deal. Bulgar picked up the cube in their room. Guardian grabbed the cube in the other side room as well as Octopus. Trent snaffled the cube on the pedestal and is the first to exit the shrine only to find that the cube had disappeared.

Party members in the shrine made for the exit but Tundra was overpowered by a flurry of stone arrows. The party eventually met the challenge of getting all their members in the shrine out safely and find that Guardian’s cube was still in being, it is the real puzzle key. Guardian gave it to Bulgar for safe keeping and they all head to the outskirts of the shrine to meet up with Hank.
Hank advised they had an encounter by a group that have 3 more cubes and a base in the palace. Armed with this information, the party decide to take a short rest before heading to another shrine under the cover of darkness. Guardian used this time to scout the surrounding area, identifying shrines and possible entry to Omu.

At the next shrine, there were broken stone doors at the entrance. In the middle of the shrine is a giant statue of a snail. Trent reads the plaque to this shrine:

“Unkh urges us to contrast all options before acting.”

Guardian investigated the shrine discovering the puzzle key to be missing. Guardian then took Unk’s key from the pedestal and leaves.

The party reviewed their plan, taking a long rest back at camp before tackling the palace base. The next day came easily, and the party set out again, finding a secret tunnel entrance into the palace. They came to a large cavern filled with water – two row boats were docked on the shore. Bulgar goes to hop in one and the cavern is suddenly filled with the noise of a bell ringing – an unbeknownst trinket attached to the boat rang out, which Bulgar tears off the boat and discards in the water. The party divide themselves between the two boats – Guardian, Hank and Bulgar in one, Leopold, Tundra, Filth Bucket and Caitlin in the second, Izzurba comfortably in the water. They travel through the veins of the under-palace and come across a Hydra alerted by the bell on the rowboat earlier but use their array of talent and skill to lay waste to the monster.

How was that for a session? Is the party ready for the next one? Are they ready for Valindra? Only one way to find out - all aboard for the next round!

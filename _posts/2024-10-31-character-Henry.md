### Background
Lightwood Company, Founder and Company Commander

DOB: 10 Marpenoth, 1446 DR (Deceased 1496 DR)

(he/him)





The late Henry Lightwood founded the mercenary group Lightwood Company in 1479 DR with nine others, himself a grizzled adventurer of over thirty summers. He was murdered in 1496 DR by agents of the lich Acererak, as he had been investigating strange rumours arriving from nearby Chult.

Henry was a rough man, with long unkempt hair, crude tattoos, and a menacing moustache; but he was also known as a gentle hearted soul, with a keen sense of justice, and a deep desire to better the world he lived in. Along with his husband, Harold Knight, he adopted a handful of children in the years he ran the company, taking himself out of active service to run the company full time from the Lightwood Company House he was murdered in.

Scores of adventurers and mercenaries up and down the sword coast, and as far inland as the dales, knew and respected Henry, and his murder was met with shock and sadness. Worse still was the rumoured inability of Harold to breathe life back into his husband, which was later proven to be a result of Acererak’s death curse on Faerun.

When Acererak was defeated and the souls he had captured were freed, Henry appeared stoically to the Lightwood Company and blessed the future journeys of his beloved compañeros and their new found crew. His spirit ascended to Elysium, there to rest with the spirits of those that came before him.

### Previously on T-TOA…
The party followed cart tracks leading deep into the dwarven mines. They came to a spooky cavern where a stone bridge crossed a dark crevasse. They were filled with an unnatural feeling when suddenly, they encountered several Specters. Amid the supernatural skirmish, Guardian is grappled by the largest Specter and despite the valiant efforts of Caitlin and Aurora, is pulled off the edge of the crevasse by the Specter falling together into the darkness. Even after battle, Nera’s Wildshape bat found no trace of Guardian. She did however notice a glow similar to the Specters in the water at the bottom of the crevasse.

The heroes continued further into the mine’s tunnels for what felt like hours and take rest. Smoke had another dream, of the same skeletal gunslinger ready for a deadly game of quickdraw. This time the skeletal gunslinger was just that little bit faster, winning the showdown before the nightmare ended.

The party came to another cavern but filled with mining Kobolds, whom they successfully snuck past, into what they quickly understood to be the cave of the red dragon. The dragon appeared to be asleep atop a pile of gold and treasure. That is until it stirred by the sounds of miners chasing after a runaway cart. Realising intruders were present, the dragon set off boulder traps, blocking the party from escaping the cave. What followed was the most epic of battles, but the dragon narrowly escaped through an overhead cave opening, taking with it clutches of treasures including Hank’s staff and tome. Hank shouted in the party’s minds at the loss, but recovered and commended the party for their effort. The party looted the treasures in the cave discovering a battleaxe named ‘Bob’ taken by Smoke, a golden scabbad picked up by Fred, a chain with a dragon on it, and 6 potions pocketed by Nera. Not to mention a fair bit of gold.

With the pillaging done with, the party focussed on clearing the mines, but came across a hypno-toady rock creature that turned you to stone should you fail constitution. Never fear, no frog is a match for this party, who cleared the entire lower level of the mine of amphibian and kobold beings. 

This session, we join our heroes as they head up to the next level of the mine. What awaits them in the echelons of this mine? Will Hank ever find his gear? Where is Guardian? When will Fred remove his hat? Let’s see if the road ahead has been laid with dwarven yellow bricks..

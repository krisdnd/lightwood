### Background
Lightwood Company, Founder and Veteran (joined 1479 DR)

DOB: Midwinter, 1390 DR

(he/him)




Durin and his late brother Flegha were known as the Rageface twins, a pair of hearty dwarves that were founding members of the Lightwood Company. Since his brothers death at the hands of frost giants in 1491, Durin has lost some of the positivity and charm he was known throughout the company for, but he is still a steadfast ‘wooder (as he calls members of the company) through and through.

Durin is a barbarian, and typically wears a kilt and little else but blue face paint. He has tattoos from artists across Faerun (and even one from a trip to Sigil with Astaria), roughly half of which he remembers getting. Most have little to no specific meaning, he simply liked the pattern or image on offer, or let the tattoo artist have carte blanche.

In combat Durin rushes to the front to take on the enemy with his trusted Greataxe, Jessitha. He claims she was named for his long lost love back in the halls of his youth. It’s a well known ‘secret’ in the company that she was named after a stunning elven noble Durin took a liking to, but would never admit.

Durin can often be found in the mess hall or in the company of one of the officers in the officers mess. He is a compulsive and rather terrible gambler, and has become even riskier since Flegha’s passing. Another well known tale in the company is that he almost lost his soul to a mecha-demon in a hand of flapjacket in Sigil, and that he was incredibly lucky to escape with his spirituality intact.

### Background
Lightwood Company, Founder and Veteran

DOB: 23 Eleasis, 1470 DR

(he/him)





Kert was one of Henry Lightwoods closest companions during his adventuring years, and his best friend once the company leader had put down roots on the sword coast at Lightwood Company House.

Ageing faster than the humans around him, the Ogrillon (half-ogre, half-orc) grew up fast on the streets of waterdeep, and managed to eke out an existence apprenticed to a mages guild. Showing an aptitude for magic, he was schooled for several years, graduating as a wizard far ahead of (and several heads taller than) his classmates.

Kert is self conscious of his height, and often hunches his seven foot frame down to around six and a half feet to feel like he can fit in. His eyesight has degraded rapidly since the founding of the company, and from around 1483 he was nicknamed ‘old man’ by the recruits and regulars. Well respected among the veterans and captains of the company, he was referred to by them as ‘Master Kert’, as he grew into a habit of teaching and often lecturing the younger (if not physically, then certainly mentally) members of the company.

Kert was devastated by Henry’s murder, and lead the second wave of Lightwood mercenaries to Chult somewhat dissociated by his sudden leadership role. He blamed himself for the groups crash upon the islands shores, and suffers some PTSD from his time captured at the pirate grove.

His confidence shattered, he watched as the younger members of the company lead the offensive into the Tomb of the Nine Gods, and was re-energised by their victory of the demilich. He continues to decline a leadership position, but has become the wizened sage of the Lightwood Company. A man that stands apart from those around him for a multitude of reasons, and with some triggers from loud noises and combat, Kert has befriended Hank and is one of the few outside the Lightwood leadership group to know of the Alhoon’s true nature.

Kert can often be found in the library, reading or playing chess against Hank, or giving lessons alongside (though at times, in some conflict with) Garold in the mess or on the main deck. He eschews combat where possible, and in battle can be found in sickbay preparing for and treating any wounded.

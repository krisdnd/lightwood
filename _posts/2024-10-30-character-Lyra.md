### Background
The Dark CroWo (Oversized Hammership, 80 Ton Cruiser)

DOB: Unknown

(she/her)




Queen of her own castle (as she calls it), Captain Lyra is a fun loving, wenching, rough as a dog’s guts pirate, although a little less cutthroat than some. Like Huffington of the Dardanelle, the captain of the Dark CroWo isn’t a run of the mill murder happy pirate, preferring to board and take her pick of loot and prisoners and leave her conquests to spread tales of her infamy. That said, he won’t shirk from shedding blood if a fight looks ripe, and she’s quick to pull the trigger if the situation requires it.

Full of witty cacheisms and a complete flirt, Lyra is a member of the Bard College of Roasts, a relatively little known school that focuses on demoralising opponents with a cutting wit. Why fight an opponent hand to hand, when instead you can call their parentage into question and tilt them, THEN fight them hand to hand.

Lyra runs an all female crew, aside from her mute valet Upsiday. She’s prone to wanderlust, and has covered more space in her time than any other pirate, and while she appears human there’s a touch of something else about her that has lead to a much longer life than she shows signs of. There’s something quite special about Lyra’s parentage, at least on one side, and she often mentions how her ‘Dear old Mum’ likes to get around, and she has a sibling or two in every system from here to the Beholder Triumvirate.

### Background
Blackrock, Harbormaster and Challenge Official

DOB: irregular

(he's/him's)



Few know the origins of Blackjammers seemingly endless army of Harbormasters, but every spacer worth their salt from Blackrock to H’Catha knows of Many Manny. While each individual Many Manny appears slightly different in dress, mannerism, and physical health, him’s all share a deep loyalty to Blackjammer and have served him since he took over Blackrock Cove.

Many Manny appears as a regular, albeit quirky, human. The fact that there may be several or even a score of Many Manny aside, he’s have a bumbling, almost comical presence, that often leads those around him’s to disregard his’s presence. This has proven ill advised on many an occasion, as some snide comment assumed to be behind Blackjammers back has found the speaker blown from wildspace along with whichever Many Manny happened to be nearby to hear it.

Many Manny is certainly magical, and has little record for his’s own life. Many Manny is the proverbial sword over the head of every ship entering Blackjammers Challenge, as each ship bears host to one or more Many Manny who detonate in an incredibly destructive explosion under a multitude of conditions.

Scuttle around Blackrock is that Many Manny is a singular consciousness that inhabits multiple bodies at once, as information clearly passes between his’s self instantly. He’s have been used by Blackjammer as messengers as well as challenge officials, and one several rumoured occasions as an explosive gift in a sealed, personally addressed crate.

Regardless, Many Manny seems either resigned to or completely unaffected by his’s fate, and continues to serve Blackjammer quite happily. Truth be told, Many Manny is possibly the happiest, most care free person (or persons) of any that set foot, tentacle, or claw aboard Blackrock station.

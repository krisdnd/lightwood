### Cutscence
A magical hum emanated from the runes in the Lightwood camp, and a blue shimmering portal split the air with a thrumming sound. Trent, Fred, Neera, Smoke and others turned to see strangers stumble through, dressed not just for the warm climate, but to reveal as much flesh as tantalisingly possible.

A moment later Hank strode through, its familiar form bent low to clear the top of the portal. Those watching on felt a familiar twisting at the base of their neck as deja-vu accompanied their eyes settling on Hank, before they moved forward to welcome what was clearly more lost sheep into their fold.

With a wave of its ebony skinned hand Hank dismissesd the energy holding the portal open, the magic twisting and sliding together as the aperture grew smaller. Just before it closed Hank turned to look through it, a curious yet familiar look on its face, clearly having sensed something.

It strode to Trent, who was handing water to the parched newcomers, and placed a hand on his shoulder.

There was something as the portal closed, Trent heard in his head, Hanks’ mental voice directed towards him. A presence I haven’t felt since… The being trailed off, looking back to the north east.

‘Woah, yeah man, but I doubt you’re endangering the mission’ the bard offered. Hank turned its face back to regard the human, confused at the reference, before turning away and seeking the solace of its tent.

‘Yeah, I never got into that story either.’ Trent said, turning to a parched, well oiled man who had stepped up for water. ‘Woah, shiny’.

Some minutes later the camp had returned to its standard low key vibe, Trent seated on a log and strumming on his guitar with an array of camp followers before him, when the quiet of the city was shattered. Pterodactyl cries shattered the lyrical poetry, their shrieks echoing across the dead city of Omu as they flew skyward. In the distance dark specs could be seen rising from the ruined palace grounds, fleeing some terror.

A crack of thunder shook the sky, dark clouds surging in, boiling out of nothing to quickly dim the day. First one, and then another, forks of green blue lightning stabbed upward from the ground, crawling along the underbelly of the unnatural cloud cover, like fingers seeking a way towards the heavens.

The lightning disappeared as quickly as it had come, darkening the city further as the clouds boiled and blackened. They spread, covering the sky from horizon to horizon, and the temperature dropped as fast as the light disappeared.

All of Chult lay in darkness, unnatural, foiling even darkvision and magical senses. In Port Nyanzaru, dinosaurs roared and thrashed at their posts. A torrent of bats poured like a wave from the mouth of the Wyrmheart mine, screaming like tortured rodents. At the Heart of Ubtao, a Red Wizard Lich paused in her writing, as a gust of cold air blew out even her magical candles. At the camp, Hank stood untouched by the chill wind, before turning to walk atop a nearby hill.

Monkeys, dinosaurs, bats, and other animals shrieked, brayed, and screamed in the jungle. In the city, in the mine, and in the camp, the less stalwart of mortals crouched in terror, while those nobler or more sinister stood up, and turned toward the Palace of Omu, feeling it’s direction more than seeing it.

Although see it, those nearest did.

A dull glow of green blue grew slowly, tentatively, and pulsed like a heart before fading away. It grew back again, faster, brighter, spreading out from the palace before beating again, and then drawing back inward upon itself. A third time it grew, this time with an audible thub-thub, before the land faded back into unnatural light. A fourth time, still brighter. A fifth time, still louder. A sixth, with an intensity that all but two of those watching turned away from. 

They waited for the seventh beat to toll.

Hank stood, ebony hand gripping its black iron staff tightly, unblinkingly towards the palace from a vantage point on a nearby hill. Valindra Shadowmantle stumbled, one hand gripping the cave wall at one of the entrances to the Heart of Ubtao, raising her dead eyes towards the exact same point as Hank. The wind stilled unnaturally, and the Lich tilted her head as if to listen with long dead elven ears, for the first time in an age feeling the barest flicker of doubt in her dead heart.

‘No’ both Hank and Valindra uttered simultaneously thiugh miles apart, as the sickly blue green glow flashed brighter than any dawn, and from the palace a continuous lightning bolt shot across the sky above Hank. The bolt cracked and shook with a life of its own, tail pinned at the Palace of Omu, the other end lashing out to wrap around the Heart of Ubtao and tear it from its unearthly moorings. Valindra leapt from the floating rock as necromantic lightning danced around the Heart, using her magic not to fall softly but to push away, sending her shooting downward like a meteor that would leave her buried metres into the marsh below.

The lightning writhed, pulling back and up, dragging the Heart of Ubtao up into the air above Chult. Fingers of the magic tore into the rock like claws into a ripened fruit. The energy bent backward, like a fishing line bending with a string catch, and drew the Heart closer and closer to Omu.

All living things in, under, or around the city felt the rumbling of a powerful quake, and threw themselves to the ground or braced themselves wherever they could. Glancing up, Trent could see that only Hank seemed untouched, standing - no, levitating some inches above the hill. It’s hand reached out towards the Heart of Ubtao as if to stop it, and its face was twisted in concentration.

Within moments, the heart settled several hundred metres above the palace, the lightning now forming a long loop away, anchored underneath. A shudder ran along the energy, like a curve along a whipped rope, and the lightning snapped to loop one, two, three, four, five, six, and then seven times around the heart until no length was spared.

The rumbling continued, and near the palace grounds Guardian, Caitlyn, Izzurba, Aurora, Leopold, Tundra, and Bolgar picked themselves up warily. ‘Come, come’ cried Filthbucket, dashing away from the palace, beckoning his companions to run away, as small pieces of the Heart fell around them.

Run they did.

The quake became more powerful where the lightning anchored, and weaker at a distance, obeying not the natural laws of physics. As they fled, it became easier for those in the city to move unhindered, and at the camp all were free to move easily and check for any injuries. Indeed, Trent stood and walked cautiously towards Hank atop the hill, stopping some ten feet away, his instrument held tightly in his hand.

Hank turned, and looked deep into Trents eyes… and yet wasn’t, and was still turned away somehow…

Without warnong the seventh beat came, as the lightning crushed the Heart of Ubtao and shattered it like a porcelain egg.

THUD- the first half of the beat, the lightning squeezed like a fist, sending cracks through the Heart.

-THUD the second half of the beat, as the Heart, the lightning, and the palace exploded in blue green energy.

Trent found himself at the bottom of the hill, upside down against a rock, his guitar still gripped tightly in one bruised hand - safe, but for two broken strings. A ringing echoed in his ears, but then that was pretty normal for the front man.

Everyone in the camp had been knocked to the ground, tents lay collapsed from the shockwave, and several crates and barrels lay broken spilling food and supplies.

In the city, the vanguard of the Lightwood picked themselves up out of rubble and detritus, and coughed stone dust that until moments ago was the remains of the heart of the lands god. Other denizens of the city found themselves similarly inconvenienced and beaten about - where they survived at all.

Hank floated unmarred atop the hill hand slowly dropping back to it’s side. 

In the distance, a muddy Valindra clawed her way out of a hole and swore in ancient Thayan.

The ruin of the palace glowed dully but steadily, and as the dust began to settle it caught and floated in the magic glow. An unnatural wind drove the dust toward the gaping chasm in the south east of the city, moving to swirl above the blackened abyss. Slowly the dust sprinkled down into the dark, and the magical glow drew inward to a single point that hovered above the city.

The seven quickly realised it was moving, heading directly to their camp, and that they had no hope of catching it. Indeed even as Izzurba began to think of ways to intercept it, the energy sped up, and made its way to the camp in seconds.

Trent watched the bluegreen mote fly straight past Hank as if the mysterious ‘scholar’  wasn’t even there. The light zipped in front of his own face before shooting into the middle of the camp. He leapt up and ran after it, coming to a skidding halt at the edge of the camp as Smoke fired his pistol straight into the light with no effect.

His clip empty in seconds, Smoke slackened his pose, and opened his mouth to quip something sassy just as glowing tendrils shot out from the light at everyone present, penetrating their chests and wrapping around their hearts

Except for Hank, of course, who stood impotently next to Trent. As far as the energy was concerned, it was like Hank wasn’t even there.

The energy paralysed every being in the camp from the moment it touched them, and they all felt it tear away at their essence. First among the weaker of the refugees, then among the rookies of the company, and finally even those most stalwart, the magic tore their souls out of them. One by one ghostly phantoms of those present were sucked back into the magic, which grew brighter and stronger with each soul. A misty shape began to resolve around the mote, an enormous skeletal arch-lich that none could deny was their primary opponent, Acererak. The figure opened his jaw and began to laugh a chill toll of the dead.

‘Ha ha ha ha.’

He rotated slowly, beckoning each soul towards him, until just three remained steuggling against his power - the souls of Trent, Smoke, and their albino guide Musharib. A shimmering white shield faded into being around Musharibs soul, magical dwarven runes rotating slowly in the air around it, halting the arch-lichs victorious laugh. 

The enormous bone head tilted, as though amused, and he raised one bony hand to point directly at Musharib. ‘Well if you want to keep him…’ he rasped, before shooting a green lightning bolt through the albino dwarf, continuing, ‘then you best hold him close’.

Musharibs soul flew back into his body, and he fell to the ground with a fist sized hole throughhis chest. Acererak wrapped an enormous clawed hand around the last two streams of magic, dragging the the last mortal souls to him as he rasped:

‘Fear the night when the forsaken one seizes death’s mantle, and the seas dry up, and the dead rise, and I ACERERAK, THE ETERNAL, REAP THE WORLD OF THE LIVING!’

And then he without warning he was gone, the black clouds evaporated, and light touched once more upon Chult.

But not a single mortal present felt its warmth.

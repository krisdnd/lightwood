### Previously on T-TOAâ€¦

Down the stairs of the dungeon.

Chased a blue orb.

Narrowly missed by a cart.

Aurora's message from the future.

Three giant cog rooms protected by coloured magic. The orbs are the keys.

Blood zombies.

Blood blob king.

Next cog has skeletons mounds.

Flying cube called "Numbers" guarding the yellow orb asked for credentials.

Made friends with Numbers, giving it a new purpose.

Izzurba cast a net to pry the key from the spirit swarm when it burst and attacked.

The massive swarm was tough to kill.

### Previously on T-TOA…
Welcome adventurers! To the new year and back to the campaign where we rejoined our heroes at camp where Smoke healed Musharib. But Musharib’s wounds were too great and he bid the party a final farewell to spend the remainder of his time in Hrakamar with his people. Musharib reminded the party that boon is owed but Hank could help. He disappeared into the portal for the last time and the party took a long rest at camp, during which Izzurba identified some magic items and Hank offered 2 health potions to each of the adventuring members.

The party deliberated their next steps and decided to head to the next point of interest on their map. On arrival they observed images of snarling bears on the entrance to the shrine. There was also the inscription: 

“Obo-Laka teaches us to tread wearily and stay in the light.”

The shrine door was slightly ajar, so Tundra opened it to find a dark hallway, walls covered with paintings and lined with sconces missing their torches. Izzurba illuminated the way and at the end of the corridor, the party discovered a well in the centre of a room with a sun-carved hole directly above it. Looking into the well, the reflection was a moon. Guardian entered the well portal to be delivered in another room and found a hidden door leading to a chamber. This had lit torches in wall sconces, a puzzle cube on a pedestal and 2 statues that appeared to be life-like rogue figures frozen in motion, one with their hand on the cube and runes carved into their skill, and the other recoiling. 

The party realised this shrine is a light puzzle and pondered what to do. Eventually they settled for getting Timothy the Octopus to retrieve the cube after the lit torches were moved to the entry hallways, which made the people in the paintings happy. Timothy retrieved the puzzle cube successfully, Guardian stowed both rogue statues in their bag of holding and the party left the shrine to meet Hank.

Guardian unbagged the statues to which Hank imparted one was a red wizard and believed the other to be an academic scholar explorer with another puzzle cube sticking out of their backpack. This made up the mind of Izzurba who casted Stone to Flesh on the scholar stone creature. It reanimated into a grey-skinned elephant and tells the party it was called Adjunct Professor "Garold" Garistold Pavheydea Hyperion XVI, Esq. Academic, historian, scientician, chemist, psiologist, and they have been in the shrine for 2 weeks. Guardian and Garold bartered about the cube and ultimately Garold agreed to loan the cube and join the party on their adventures.

Our heroes then travelled to the next point of interest and came to a ruined amphitheatre that was eerily silent. Izzurba casted to detect a cube but none were there. Tundra, Caitlin and Filth Bucket made their way down to the stage of the amphitheatre. The rest of party froze, looking in that direction - a T-rex was right behind the three, and so began the Jurassic encounter. The T-rex eventually made a stage exit providing a magical helmet and 250 gp loot.

Can you believe our heroes right now? They just defeated a T-rex!! Woop woop! They have really developed into a force not to be reckoned with. But will it be enough to defeat the soul stealing Acererack? Let’s see what transpires this session!

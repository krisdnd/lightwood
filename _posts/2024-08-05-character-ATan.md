### Background
Omuan merchant

DOB: 1348 DR

(they/them)




The first of the crew freed from the mirror of life trapping, A’tan was a humble yet very successful merchant in Omu. While their mercantile skills were superb, sadly their mental fortitude was quite frail, and they were driven slowly insane inside the extra-dimensional space.

With psychosurgery from Frank, support by fellow omuan Lukanu, and many patient and delicate conversations with the crew, A’tan has mostly recovered from the ordeal, and is ready and offering to represent the Lightwood Company at the trading tables. Their common is still stilted, and they often forgets words or speaks them in the wrong order, but for someone who has only been speaking common for a month or so they are doing quite well.

A’tan is somewhat agoraphobic towards crows, and claustrophobic towards spaces, due to their time within the mirror. They occasionally suffers recurring night terrors of the foggy space and can be seen on the open deck with a death grip on the rails, somewhat sleep deprived. These night terrors seem to affect them only when they sleep indoors, and they have been known to nap on the open deck occasionally, but they insist on continuing to try sleeping indoors as part of their recovery.

When not on the open deck or challenging themself to brave the tight confines and groups inside the ship, A’tan has made a peaceful place for themself as the ships quartermaster, and can be found keeping inventory in the hold and spillage. They can find any item within the hold within thirty seconds of being asked, no matter how big or small, and are expert at valuing goods.

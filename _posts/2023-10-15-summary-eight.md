At the Kubazan shrine, the party were rejoined by Crackers who was accompanied by Aurora, Bork and a new face, Izzurba. Aurora and Izzurba shared they saw graffiti on the way that said, ‘All hail the king of feathers’ and ‘Fear the fangs of Rasni.’ Guardian recalled that the King of feathers dwells in the city of Omu and imparts information the rest of the party know about Rasni. The party decided to head to an area of interest to the East of the shrine. They encountered Snek people and easily defeat them, but notice the city had gone unusually quiet. Loot found after the battle is a Stone to Flesh scroll pocketed by Izzurba, as well as scimitars, etc taken by Guardian. As the party backtracked through the city, they come across more graffiti; ‘Beware the frog monster’ – a pre-warning for the Froghemoth they had witnessed at the shrine of Kubazan. The next shrine is adorned with statues of Jaculi (Jaguars) with snakes. Guardian recalls the tale of Shagambi who saw trouble in the people of Omu’s hearts. Shagambi fashioned a spear to eradicate it, but it was stolen by a frog and Shagambi chased it across the sky creating the constellation. There is an inscription in the shrine that reads ‘Shagambi teaches us to fight evil with honour.’ Two large, heavy shrine doors frame the entrance and some members of the party go through them even though Guardian’s spell to check for traps fails. Bordering the internal walls of the shrine, were four stone statues, arms outstretched as if to hold an invisible spear. To the back of the shrine room was a pedestal alike the one in the shrine of Kubazan but the puzzle piece was missing. Tundra having eagerly entered the shrine, jumps on the pedestal, striking it with her axe. Suddenly, the doors to the shrine close, separating the party and trapping those who entered the shrine. Poisonous gas began filling the shrine room, and during Guardian’s effort to coax Tundra off the pedestal, the gas ceases and the doors open. The rest of the party enter, and they all venture deeper into the shrine where they encounter four clay soldiers, each sporting a spear. In tight proximity, the party conquered the soldiers and placed their spears in the four statues where the pedestal was located. The pedestal rotated and released the second puzzle key. Izzurba retrieved it and as they did, there was a light earthquake outside. Oooo ominous indeed! But can you believe the party now have 2 of the 9 puzzle keys? Easy squeezy, don’t feel uneasy. Still 7 to go! And this party are clearly the absolute epitome of perfection to get the job done. Let’s see how they tackle the next challenge.

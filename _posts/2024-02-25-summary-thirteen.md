### Previously on T-TOA…

Whilst Izzurba identified a helmet as the Helm of Telepathy, a battle-shook and in between waterskin swigs, Garold, thanked the party for helping them overcome the T-rex, handed over the last puzzle cube and admitted battle is not for them choosing to forgo future encounters. So the party headed back to camp, where Izzurba announced the good news about acquiring all the cubes to Hank. Hank began telling the party his story – see cutscene Hank Exposition.
When Hank was done, he gave the party boon including health potions (takes 1 round to use/drink and heals to full HP) and a black potion (brings back a player from death but in a different way and they can’t heal properly), opened a portal to the last tomb and let them through.

At the base of the cliff-face entrance to the tomb and around the basin of the area, there were gargoyles that take Tundra’s interest. In the centre, there was an obelisk that Aurora sensed a fiendish feeling from and had an inscription the party would later find useful:

‘Fear the night when the forsaken one seizes death’s mantle and the seas dry up and the dead rise and I, Acererak the eternal, reap the world of the living. Those who dare enter take heed:
The enemies oppose.
One stands between them.
In darkness, it hides.
Don the mask or be seen.
Speak no truth to the doomed child.
The keys turn on the inside only.’

Bulgar and Aurora proceeded to investigate a side tunnel entrance – there were 8 Gods atop bowls of oil and Bulgar discovered the end with the God, Unkh, is a hidden door. As Izzurba passed through the tunnel, the oil underneath the Gods he passed lit up, and as he reached the end of the tunnel, the hidden door opened. Unkh was wearing a golden amulet that Aurora sensed exuded divination magic so Izzurba took the amulet and they all left the tunnel.

As Izzurba walked between the obelisk and the gargoyles, he felt himself pulled by the amulet to the West. He followed this pull with the party in tow to another entrance with 9 square holes the size of the cube keys. Trent recalled the 9 alignments and that each of the creatures on the cubes represented an alignment. Armed with this information, the party worked together to arrange the cube keys in their respective slots and successfully unlocked the entrance, only to happen upon a second puzzle room, but timed. The lever went up, the lever went down. Then up, then down. Up, down, many times until finally the party just left the lever to count down and the ground door receded into the ground.

Our heroes began navigating the dungeons, defeated a demon and came across a room with a metal statue covered with armour and a metal shield, pulling particularly at Aurora. Aurora sensed transmutation magic from the statue and Trent casted Dispell Magic which stopped the pull from the statue. The party found a secret door to a tomb and Tundra under the effects of Invisibility disarmed the trap so they could enter and investigate unharmed. Aurora sensed a lingering presence and Trent tried on a feather mask which made everything look dull except for the casket. Bulgar opened the casket, saw a ring, put it on and became possessed by Obo-laka although all the party saw was the dust take the shape of a bear then swirl towards Bulgar. The party took the 6 masks of Obo-laka from the tomb and headed North.

They came across a pond with statues and Bulgar stated not to drink the water. Izzurba identified that drinking the water will change you in some way. On the way out of the pond room, the party noticed a skeleton walking down the corridor, a bone key shaped atop its head, which Tundra decapitates and gives to Izzurba for safekeeping. The head has a number 1 on the back of it – the party realise this is one skeleton key collected.

They continued exploring towards the West and came face to face with a mega skull whose mouth was big enough to climb through. Tundra picked up Filth Bucket and threw him in – one of the lights on the eyes went out. Lucy went through next and nothing happened. Aurora commanded Bork to go through who does and the other eye extinguished. Aurora followed and the jaws of the mouth clamped shut on her. Bulgar and Trent quickly reacted and helped pry open the jaws. Aurora tumbled into the skull, joining Filth Bucket, Bork and Lucy. She suddenly heard the voice of a young child coming from a small skull in a jar. Izzurba checked up on Aurora via Message and warned tell no truth to the doomed child. Aurora managed to calm the child voice with untruths, opened a casket in the space, picked up a snake head staff in the casket and unbeknownst to the rest of the party, chose to let a spirit in.

The doomed child became overwhelmed with fear and Izzurba entered the tomb and attacked the small skull. The skull began to reform, and the party members exited, headed North. They found another room with a tomb and 3 boxes, each large enough to fit in and containing an immovable key. The party deliberated on this puzzle and ended up having Aurora, Tundra and Timothy climb into the boxes and turn the keys at the same time. Aurora and Tundra took damage from setting off a trap, but the tomb became transparent revealing a monkey with a mace inside. Although it came to life when the tomb was broken by Tundra, the heroes defeated the mace-wielding monkey.

What a funhouse that turned out to be! Where will the dungeons lead this session? Will our heroes find all the skeleton keys? And who or what will they encounter in the remainder of this undiscovered tomb?\

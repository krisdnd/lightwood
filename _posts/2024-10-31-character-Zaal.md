### Background
Minotaur Gladiator Champion

DOB: unknown

(he/him)






A companion and friend of Lukanu, Zaal was a gladiator in the fighting pits of Omu long ago.

He is quiet and reserved, with a stern countenance, and brooks no fools. He appears to be completely humourless, and respects only physical prowess.

Zaal is suspicious of all spellcasters and magic in general. He avoids mirrors, a response to his years in the same mirror of lifestealing as Lukanu, and quiet spaces.

Aboard the Destiny Zaal can be found training with Lukanu, or pacing the inside of the ship.

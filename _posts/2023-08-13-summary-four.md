### Previously on T-TOA…
The party come across a familiar humanoid along the mine tracks. Guardian is safe, still immune to fire and sporting a… parrot? Anyway, the party share out their healing potions and continue upwards and onwards, clearing out the mines of Kobolds. They find an albino dwarf corpse whom Hank ‘speaks’ to and the party discover the dwarf, Thonic, met an ill end and several of its friends were fed to the dragon. Thonic also warns 100 Kobolds await a final level of the mine. Saddened, the party leave Thonic’s lifeless body to rest and resume their path through the mine. They encounter more Kobolds, an Ogre and Specters, defeating most of them whilst some of the Kobolds flee with their eggs. The loot is modest with a light staff and breastplate taken by Smoke and an Ogre nose ring pocketed by Fred. The party continue through an opening into the caves and for the first time in a while are outside, the fresh breeze a pleasant change to the stagnant earthy rock. The outside has locked shacks which are no match for Aurora’s Morningstar, although the party find nothing of apparent value. Nera wild shapes into an owl to scope the area for Kobolds with eggs. There are none in sight and the day is coming to an end, so the party seize the opportunity to take rest, whereby Aurora begins a magical trance. A stillness emanates from the jungle and the party are met with a big dog that seems to know and is affectionate with Aurora. Adorned with a collar that says ‘Bork’, the party welcome the new companion. Guardian takes a moment to look at their shoulder where ‘Crackers’ the parrot is perched, making the realisation that they are also ‘stuck’ together. Over the next 2-3 days, the party head back through the mines of Hrakamar. Hank spends a lot of this time meditating with a dragon scale found in the mines, and eventually pronounces the dragon is at the heart of Ubtao where Hank also senses magic is present. The party come to the mine’s forge where they recognise doors are installed that weren’t there before. Hank presses forward and Caitlin spots several albino dwarves that take the party in and proceed to hand sign. Aurora translates the thankful words of the albino dwarves who were attacked by humans at the sandy shore, where some of their kind have been taken as slaves, namely their leader who the party assume is Musharib. Guardian reassures the dwarves that the party will help and gives them food as the rest of the team realise the armoury supplies have been stolen and the vault emptied. As the party exit the main doors of the mine, the writing ‘courtesy of the Dark Crow Woe’ settles on them as they discern figures hanging in the nearby tree are dwarves. Mmm yes, a gloomy end of session for the party. Join them in this session as they make their way to the seashore in pursuit of vengeance for the dwarven, mistreated and fallen alike. Take out the popcorn, give Bork a biscuit and Cracker, well a cracker. Are we about to witness a nautical encounter? A classic clash of clans? …or will the party find an adult red dragon? …or just another dumb way to die?

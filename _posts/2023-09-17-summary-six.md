### Previously on T-TOA…
At the shores of the pirate cove, the party watched The Dark CroWo disappear on the horizon. As they did, they saw a small boat rowing to shore. A male pirate figure pulled the small boat to shore, offloaded chests and handed a scroll to Aurora before boarding the boat and rowing back towards The Dark CroWo. Meanwhile characters rescued include: Curly (halfling druid), Hairless Tenday (Human), Kert (half-orc mage scholar), Marrak (covered in scars), Durin (dwarven berserker) and a Centaur. Durin held out a scroll from Harold, Henry’s surviving husband. It was the charter. Kert explained they were looking for the party at the cove when it was pirated by the Dark CroWo. Kert gave further details – Harold has taken the 7 kids somewhere safe. The kids are too young to take over the company, so Harold is passing this assignment over to the party. The party read the scroll of the charter and Guardian stored it in their bag of holding. Suddenly, in the distance out to sea, a ship lifts out of the water, it turns and circles before flying off into the dawn. It’s not like the air balloon ships some have seen before at Halruaa – it moves far too fast – so the party are stunned.
The party and the rescued make their way to Hrakamar. On their way, Musharib explains he is drained from the treatment he received and needs rest before he can provide boon. During the trek, Durin pulls aside Lightwood Company members and says that Musharib is a great ally as he’s an ex-avatar of Dumathoin, a God, giving context to Musharib’s want to restore Hrakamar. The party arrive in Hrakamar and spend a few days there, getting to know a few new members of their team – Trent (a bard/warlock), Tundra and Leopold (their race is Shi). A few characters in the Lightwood Company really take to the Shi. Hank seems to be watching the newcomers, unengaging, but there is a strong sense of déjà vu and like Hank is on a different mental plane. A recovered Musharib proclaims that they have seen how the death curse is interfering and they are dedicated to continue with the party to find Omu, not to return until there is resolution.
With newfound inspiration, some of the party members head to Otamar on a retrieval mission for Hank’s gear. On their way, they see skeletons and undead being drawn SE towards peaks of flame. A couple of weeks later into their travel, they arrived at the heart of Ubtau, a gigantic, upside-down pear-shaped stone, floating 100 ft in the air, and rotating slowly as if it has magnetism. It had roots protruding out of the stone beneath with red dripping down from them. Atop was a petrified tree. Hank stated this is where the dragon is. The party all made their way up to the heart and were met by 4 entomologists who explained their master is trapped and the cavity structure of the stone is not natural. The party enter the central cave spotting a figure behind a forcefield and encountering the familiar red dragon. They defeat the dragon and Hank finally has their gear, expressing relief. Voices at the entrance to the cave alert the party and they soon discover the 4 entomologists were actually Red Wizards of Fhey, who engage in further battle, with 2 more Red Wizards appearing to join the fight. Eventually one is left and surrenders but the figure behind the forcefield casts disintegrate, executing them. She introduced herself as Valindra Shadowmantle and explains she is there as she is bothered by what is draining all the death magic.
In menacing conversation, Valindra tells that Omu is a ruined city and that He will reign hellfire. Hank advises that the party would not want her to hold the power He holds because of the depths of darkness she will bring. Hank addresses Valindra saying they will not allow them to take the power from him to which Valindra responds “Oh, I would leave it in the hands of a Uli-” but is cut off by Hank. In frustration, Valinda pulls out a book with the cult symbol and launches into a belittling education session. She imparts that the lich is Acererak. He has a soulmonger who draws in souls to presumably revive a murderous form of a God. Normally that’s what one would do, but one could also use energy from the soulmonger and biomass to prepare a Dracolich shell and transfer essence. At Valinda’s size, a snap of the fingers could kill the party before her. But with the body of a very large dragon.. Valinda says to go and uselessly seek the 9 keys of the Gods in Omu, mentioning that these give access to the Undermountain. She continues that Acererak has done this multiple times in other planes. Szass Fam won’t be happy. But Rasni who is in the Feign of the Night Serpent, is the one to look out for – he was a famous knight in Chult, something went wrong and he went from good to evil which is why Omu is the way it is now. Acererak made Rasni into a lich.
Wisely avoiding further confrontation with Valindra, the party head back to camp bearing the load of Valinda’s words. Hank comes to Guardian who now understands that Valindra wants the power of the book. Hank reiterates they believe they can stop the emergence but won’t be able to finish him off. Hank shows Guardian a vision of great destruction, spheres, each containing worlds, Hank’s people. They say they share this as a sign of trust and expect them to be trusted back in future. Meanwhile, Caitlin shares dragon plates with Tundra to make armour. Sheesh, this session got serious! Serious battles and serious conversations. What ever will our heroes do with all this serious information? Let’s find out!

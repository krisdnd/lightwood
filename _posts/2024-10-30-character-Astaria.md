### Background
Lightwood Company, Captain (1479 DR / 2944 SYOF to present)

DOB: Unknown

(she/her)




A paladin of Helm, Astaria was born in the planar city of Sigil but came to Faerun as a young foal approximately 1435 DR. She enjoyed a keen adventuring life, including a whirlwind romance with a plains Centaur Khan named Bleghky, before entering the Lightwood Company in 1479 DR as a recruit.

Astaria’s eye level and keen instincts served her well in battle, and she was promoted to the rank of company captain with Henry’s blessing. Often serving as Henry’s proxy in military campaigns, she has been an incredible asset to the company and has trained many recruits in multiple forms of combat.

Astaria is an accomplished farrier, tailor, skinner, and milliner. She has moderate carpentry skills, and has dabbled in smithing and weaving. She has adapted these roles for suitable shipboard life, as well as putting in some hours training the fresher recruits, but still finds her footing a little unsteady when the ship is at tactical speed near other objects.

She stands nearly six and a half feet tall, and weighs approximately 275lb.

### Previously on T-TOA…
The party rewind back to when they were on the shores of the pirate cove, just after being freed from the grasps of The Dark CroWo. They opened the scroll sealed with the familiar sigil of the Dark CroWo and saw it was a letter from Lyra, the Captain of The Dark CroWo. It appeared Lrya was thankful for the entertainment they provided. The party reflected that without the persuasive skills of their team, they might never have landed on the shores with their gear.

Flashback over, the party (Trent, Guardian, Tundra, Leopold, Crackers, Musharib, Hank and Filth Bucket – who is amazingly still alive given a one point he was seen running around with a dragon heart on his head) set off to Omu, the forbidden city. They stop at the outskirts of Omu, taking in the ruins and plotting their way forward. The ruined city was surrounded by sheer and crumbling cliff faces, stretching 100-150 ft high. Ahead was a road seemingly leading north through the city and to the right, there is a foreboding, deep, dark pit undead are falling into, lost to the darkness. Hank offered that it was one entrance to Acererack but the party would not survive it. Towards the middle of the pit, there is a remaining piece of pedestal land, surrounded by the pit and holding up what appears to be one of the city’s shrines. Guardian noticed that at every 100 ft bordering the city, gargoyles were situated staring down into the city. The party made their way down the road and came across common writing chiselled on a stone wall which reads:

‘Kubazan = Bravery, Shagambi = Wisdom, Moa = ?’

There are also a couple of spots on walls the letter ‘A’ for Acererak is seen.

The party continuede down the road through the city for a few minutes when they encountered hostile Yuan-Ti in the street, who are defeated quickly. With the last one’s dying breath, it said:

“We will find them before you do.” 

In the tussle, Filth Bucket found a sewer bomb and managed to set it off, creating an implosion. No one is harmed, but Filth Bucket disappeared. Hank said Filth Bucket lives and will find their way back to the party, so they continued down the road following the sounds of painful moans.

They came across a group of dogs scavenging dead bodies whom Guardian scared away and Trent found a non-magical serpent shaped bow with Amber gems in the eyes. The moaning came from a human under rubble that appears to be dying. Guardian and Leopold worked to remove the rubble, meanwhile Trent spotted an image of a snake curled in a spiral with a circle in its jaws on a stone wall nearby. Guardian gave the weak older human man a potion of healing. The man didn’t recall much but introduced themselves as Orvex, a servant of the wizards showing Guardian their servant mark. Guardian called over Hank asking if they can help and Hank removed the servant mark – Guardian experiences déjà vu when they do this. Orvex continued that he was camping with the wizards when all of a sudden there was hissing and a skull and fire. Orvex also told of 3 other groups ahead. Guardian offered Crackers to show Orvex to the camp which they accept.

The party came to a shrine to the west of the main road – it was a square structure with a large pond in front of it. The pond contained a statue of a frog in the middle. As the party stepped off the main road, Hank stopped and revealed they can’t go in, something was stopping them. Hank muttered a word or a sound, not quite understood by the other party members. In a folly of disorganisation, Guardian proceeded to circle the pond, whom Tundra decided to follow, who Leopold was compelled to follow, whom Trent followed, when without warning, a Froghemoth leaps out of the pond facing the party.

During battle with the Froghemoth, Guardian and Trent are swallowed whole but successfully escape, although to them the shrine appeared to have a green veil covering it. The Froghemoth was defeated, and the party progressed to exploring the shrine. They found an inscription Trent reads as:

‘Kubazan urges us to tread without fear and to give back as much as we take.’

The party manage the puzzle that is the shrine and successfully retrieve the stone key that Guardian stores safely in their bag of holding.

What a ribetting session! Next time, we rejoin our heroes on their quest to retrieve the 9 keys. What will they encounter in the other shrines? How will they work out their puzzles? When will Filth Bucket resurface? Why can’t Hank enter the Shrine? Whatever comes, I’m sure we are in for a toadally awesome venture.

### Previously on T-TOA…
The party rewind back to when they were on the shores of the pirate cove, just after being freed from the grasps of The Dark CroWo. They open the scroll sealed with the familiar sigil of the Dark CroWo and see it is a letter from Lyra, the Captain of The Dark CroWo. It appears Lrya is thankful for the entertainment they provided. The party reflect that without the persuasive skills of their team, they might never have landed on the shores with their gear.
Flashback over, the party (Trent, Guardian, Tundra, Leopold, Crackers, Musharib, Hank and Filth Bucket – who is amazingly still alive given a one point he was seen running around with a dragon heart on his head) set off to Omu, the forbidden city. They stop at the outskirts of Omu, taking in the ruins and plotting their way forward. The ruined city is surrounded by sheer and crumbling cliff faces, stretching 100-150 ft high. Ahead is a road seemingly leading north through the city and to the right, there is a foreboding, deep, dark pit undead are falling into, lost to the darkness. Hank offers that it is one entrance to Acererack but the party would not survive it. Towards the middle of the pit, there is a remaining piece of pedestal land, surrounded by the pit and holding up what appears to be one of the city’s shrines. Guardian notices that at every 100 ft bordering the city, gargoyles are situated staring down into the city. The party make their way down the road and come across common writing chiselled on a stone wall which reads ‘Kubazan = Bravery, Shagambi = Wisdom, Moa = ?’ There are also a couple of spots on walls the letter ‘A’ for Acererak is seen.
The party continue down the road through the city for a few minutes when they encounter hostile snek-people in the street, who are defeated quickly. With the last one’s dying breath, it says “we will find them before you do.” In the tussle, Filth Bucket finds a sewer bomb and manages to set it off, creating an implosion. No one is harmed, but Filth Bucket has disappeared. Hank says Filth Bucket lives and will find their way back to the party, so they continued down the road following the sounds of painful moans. They come across a group of dogs scavenging dead bodies whom Guardian scares away and Trent finds a non-magical serpent shaped bow with Amber gems in the eyes. The moaning came from a human under rubble that appears to be dying. Guardian and Leopold work to remove the rubble, meanwhile Trent spots a snake curled in a spiral with a circle in its jaws on a stone wall nearby. Guardian gives the weak older human man a potion of healing. The man doesn’t recall much but introduced themselves as Orvex, a servant of the wizards showing Guardian their servant mark. Guardian calls over Hank to ask if they can help and Hank removes the servant mark – Guardian experiences déjà vu when they do this. Orvex continues that he was camping with the wizards when all of a sudden there was hissing and a skull and fire. Orvex also told of 3 other groups ahead. Guardian offered Crackers to show Orvex to the camp which they accept.
The party come to a shrine to the west of the main road – it was a square structure with a large pond in front of it. The pond contained a statue of a frog in the middle. As the party stepped off the main road, Hank stopped and reveals they can’t go in, something is stopping them. Hank mutters a word or a sound, not quite understood by the other party members. In a folly of disorganisation, Guardian proceeds to circle the pond, whom Tundra decides to follow, who Leopold is compelled to follow, whom Trent follows, when without warning, a Froghemoth leaps out of the pond facing the party. During battle with the Froghemoth, Guardian and Trent are swallowed whole by it but successfully escape, although to them the shrine appeared to have a green veil covering it. The Froghemoth was defeated, and the party progressed to exploring the shrine. They found an inscription Trent reads as ‘Kubazan urges us to tread without fear and to give back as much as we take.’ The party manage the puzzle that is the shrine and successfully retrieve the stone cube puzzle piece that Guardian stores safely in their bag of holding.
What a ribetting session! Next time, we rejoin our heroes on their quest to retrieve the 9 keys. What will they encounter in the other shrines? How will they work out their puzzles? When will Filth Bucket resurface? Why can’t Hank enter the Shrine? Whatever comes, I’m sure we are in for a toadally awesome venture.

### Background
Chef, general troublemaker, source of odd smells

DOB: Unknown

(he/him)




Filthbucket was found in a pile of garbage in a Lizardfolk village of Chult. How he got there is anyoneâ€™s guess, but he has been a loyal follower of the Lightwood Company since.

Furry, scraggly, and with dog like mannerisms, Filthbucket insists he is a kobold, contrary to the draconic nature of kobolds native to Faerun. His awkward and clipped common has made it difficult to ascertain his origins, but it seems likely Filthbucket is not native to Faerun, either from a different plane of existence or somewhere in wildspace.

Filthbucket is an asset in combat, and has romantic aspirations for the shi known as Tundra. He follows her into battle, taking direction from her where he thinks it will improve his chances, but generally gets distracted by enthusiastically kill stealing from other members of the group. His sharp knife has taken down more opponents in Chult than any single member of the Lightwood Company, and he laughs maniacally every time.

Filthbucket can typically be found in the kitchen aboard the ship, where the various spices and powders he uses in his cuisine mask his signature odour. He has begun to learn the basics of hygiene, washing his hands and only using clean cutlery and equipment. When not in the kitchen he is found on the open deck where he regularly sleeps, having no dedicated quarters of his own and no company member being willing to share enclosed spaces with him.

Despite his appearance and mannerisms, Filthbucket is an excellent chef, and the Lightwood Company has never eaten heartier meals - even if they have learned not to ask questions about the ingredients.

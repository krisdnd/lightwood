### Background
Queensguard

Omuan Champion

DOB: 1372 DR

(she/her)





One of the omuans rescued from the mirror of life trapping in the Tomb of the Nine Gods, Lukanu has been a welcome fit among the crew of the Destiny and has found a kindred spirit in Aurora.

Bodyguard to the slain omuan queen, Napaka, Lukanu was trapped in the mirror before the tombs’ construction. She recalls little of the fall of the city, only that some spectral beings were attacking and she was rushing to her queens’ side to protect her before being swept away in a black cloud of magic.

Lukanu has been a great asset to the Lightwood Company, first in preventing a needless battle against the minotaur gladiator Zaal whom she recognised when also released from the mirror, and further able to assist in A’tan’s recovery as the only crew member able to speak both common and omuan fluently.

Aboard the Destiny Lukanu can be found in any of the general crew areas, but favours training in the gym, or sparring on deck with other martial crew members. Her regular duels with Zaal always attract a crowd aboard the ship, and are a frequent topic for gossip and betting among the crew.

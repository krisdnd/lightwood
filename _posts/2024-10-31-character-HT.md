### Background
Lightwood Company, Veteran (joined 1488 DR)

DOB: unknown

(he/him)





His real name unknown, Hairless Tenday was given his nickname by Durin because outside of missions he rarely speaks to anyone outside of payday, and because he has alopecia and his skin is completely devoid of hair.

Known as HT for short, he is a solemn and silent human who keeps to himself. Outside of missions he trains hard, often running, lifting weights, or improvising a parkour obstacle course.

HT is a plain and simple killer, combining some rogueish skills with those of a warrior, wearing simple leather armour and sporting a pair of knives he keeps sharp with a magical whetstone. He is always seen wearing a set of goggles that have been confirmed as magical, although the nature of them is unknown.

Aboard the ship HT can be found in the gym, in the mess hall, the crew quarters, or using the outside of the ship as a parkour course.

### Background
My compulsion to explore the arcane boundaries led me to discover things others did not want me to know. I was forced to abandon my life under the oceans and retreat to the surface.

The Lightwood company gave me lodgings and a purpose, a means to acquire more and more knowledge, and tear further at the fabric of reality until it unravels and reveals the terrible truth.

### Appearance
He is a tall, frail, bald elf, with green eyes.
To compensate for his lack of physical presence, he wears emerald robes with extravagant, elaborate flared shoulders.
One solitary white hair sits atop his otherwise bald head.
His facial features are angular and cruel.

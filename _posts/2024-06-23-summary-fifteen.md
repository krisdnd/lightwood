### Previously on T-TOA…

Our intrepid band of adventurers stirred from their long rest, the echoes of dreams and whispered secrets still lingering. Guardian, ever practical, secured their bag of holding to Bork’s sturdy frame before departing to aid Hank. Caitlin, however, experienced an otherworldly visitation in the night—an encounter with Luci.

Returning through the mystical portal to the tomb, the party confronted a black wooden door adorned with a face-shaped knocker. Moa, the wise guide, cautioned Aurora that this threshold held perilous secrets. Meanwhile, Wongo whispered to Tundra, urging destruction. Tundra rapped on the door, and its eyes flickered to life. “You may enter,” the face intoned, then extinguished its gaze.

Beyond the door lay a chamber—a desk, a skeleton key, and a mysterious humanoid. The enigmatic figure revealed there were five locks, each a gateway to certain doom, before vanishing despite Izzurba’s counterspell. Suddenly hand swarms engaged the heroes in a chaotic battle. During battle, the undead humanoid reappeared behind Izzurba for a wizard battle, but was defeated.

Izzurba, ever curious, rifled through the necromancer’s belongings; a spellbook and a skull amulet. On the table; mouldy journals, an arcane rock and a necromancy spellbook that bore the cryptic words “Khomara Blackfire” on the back. A journal entry revealed the humanoid’s identity: Withers. Tundra took the skeleton key labelled II.

Carrying on, the party descended a spiral staircase until they came across purple mould near a door on level 3. Inside, they discovered a lever-controlled room spun like a malevolent trap after grappling with a reanimated statue. Through a crawlspace, Timothy found a room with a gold skull that Bolgar and Caitlin explored. Caitlin picked up the skull and it began an array of bad pickup lines. Undeterred by the skull’s flirtatious banter, Caitlin ventured deeper in the room, uncovering a Froghemoth statue and a series of ancient murals depicting offerings to the creature.

With all the party members assembled in the room, Caitlin lit a candle and placed it on the offering stone, summoning wraiths. Only when she donned a mask, mirroring the mural, did the sarcophagus yield. Braces (pg. 155) were inside and Bolgar’s touch unleashed Kubazan, displacing Obo-laka.

The party pressed on, revealing a boar-headed wall that charmed the party until it was destroyed. At this point, Caitlin’s frustration with the persistent skull led to its costly liberation (-10k gp).

Further exploration revealed god-statues in a split-level room, their rotation teleporting a golem between levels. The heroes defeated it and Aurora pocketed a key, while Caitlin’s curiosity stirred a lumpy piece of mould, revealing movement beneath. Izzurba’s revelation of correctly rotating the gods, guided Bolgar and Aurora to a chest below, containing two eerie eyeballs on a cushion—one pink, one green.

And so, our heroes tread the fine line between danger and destiny, their path a test by cryptic clues and ancient magic. What awaits them in the depths? Only time—and their courage—will reveal the truth. Let’s jump back in!


Note: We are also in possession of 2 x 1” diameter crystal eyeballs – purple and blue. We found this loot on the dead dwarf in the tomb.

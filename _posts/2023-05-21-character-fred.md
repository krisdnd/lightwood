### Background
A regular member of the Lightwood Company. Not quite an elf, not quite a human, this half-elf bard has trouble trusting their allies. Regardless Fred still treats others with dignity and respect although tends to act before thinking. This has led to him sporting an unmovable top hat as well as a Jamaican accent and bad odour that only others can hear and smell. 

### Appearance
Medium size, red hair, light and freckled skin, blue eyes, 50 years old

### Previously on T-TOA…
The party arrived at the sandy coast in search of Musharib and the dwarven slaves. They came to a 50 ft tall, gated cave entrance that Nera’s Wildshape owl flew over to scout. Although there were no signs of the captives, she observed a humming pirate cove and less obvious way to enter the area, which is where the party congregated and formulated a plan. The plan? Why, to stealthily sneak into the cove and question a pirate as to the captive’s whereabouts. How did the plan go? Explosive. It started with Smoke and Guardian creeping up behind a couple of pirates to knock them out, but the pirates raised alarm and what followed was a procession of more pirates riled up for battle but stopped short by Smoke’s fiery blast. Caitlin was on the way to smash face when the pirates that are left unexpectedly surrender. The party learn that the Dark CroWoe was actually out at sea in the heavy boat scouted earlier by Nera. Embarrassed, the party left the cove and, casually walking on water, headed out to sea. They board the ship of the suspected Dark CroWoe and find the female-only crew as well as their captives were concealed by invisibility. A pun-filled battle royale ensues, during which members of the Lightwood Company recognise Saltine, a fellow member of the syndicate. The combat ends resulting in 14 saved captives, including the albino dwarves and Musharib. Guardian and Aurora attempt to persuade the Dark CroWoe to handover the dwarven loot when Sheila Marduke (also recognised by Lightwood Company members) advises not to test their luck, and the party and their captives are suddenly in the water, splaslethes echoed by muffled laughter of the pirate leader. This session, we rejoin our heroes and their rescued captives at the shore. Who are all these rescued prisoners? Will the dwarves of the Hrakamar mines finally be able to go about their lives peacefully? What is that red dragon is doing right now I wonder? Perhaps reading through Hank’s tome with a monocle while sipping tea.

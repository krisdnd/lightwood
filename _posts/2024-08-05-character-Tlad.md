### Background
Drow Thaumaturgist

DOB: 1254 DR

(he/him)




A well spoken and highly intelligent wizard, Tlad was released from a mirror of life trapping within the Tomb of the Nine Gods by the Lightwood company in 1496 DR. He revealed he had been within the mirror for nearly a hundred years, and marvelled that his many enemies and nemesi were likely thus deceased by the current era.

Tlad is a rarity amongst drow males, in that he oozes self confidence and disdain for all around him. He keeps to himself among the crew, preferring to eat his meals alone and generally shunning the company of others. Izzurba and Frank are the only crew members to garner even a shred of respect from him, although it appears to be mostly professional in nature.

Aboard the Destiny he can be found in the library, studying or playing battle chess with any would-be challengers, sipping from a magical glass that transmutes any liquid poured into it into black underdark wine (which he refuses to share).

Tlad is the epitome of ‘work smarter, not harder’, and uses his magic to avoid performing shipboard duties with his own hands. Even during ship to ship combat he is relaxed, sitting back on a chair near one of the heavy weapons, reading from a book that floats in front of him while cradling his drink in one hand, and directing magical energies to act as a weapon crew member with the other.

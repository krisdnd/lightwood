(they/them)




Endemic Quick, named for their habit of starting rumours and jokes amongst the company and their lightning fast wit, is a brain kept alive in a majika-mekanikal hybrid device. Henry found their brain floating in a jar of brine, locked in a cabinet in a biomancers laboratory he was dismantling in the earliest years of the company.

The biomancers notes lead Henry to delicately (or rather, as delicately as Henry could) remove the brain from the brine and place it in the device, which connected to the brain with thin copper tubing and brought it back to a rosier glow. The notes described the kidnapping and murder of a multitude of individuals, leaving the brains origins unclear, but Henry studied the notes and continued to feed the equipment it’s doses of salts, powdered bone, and crushed watersblood root to keep the brain alive for many years before it began to show signs of actual life.

Maimed and wrecked by the biomancers experiments, they had slowly became aware of their surroundings through the majika sensors of the device, and eventually began to make sounds through its voicebox. It took several weeks of gentle coaching by Henry and his husband, Harold, for the brain to be able to form coherent sentences and discuss their situation, but less than six months after their first scratchy ‘hellllllp’ they were performing incredibly well received stand up comedy on the stage of the Lightwood Company House.

In 1493 Henry formally inducted Endemic into the company, first as a recruit, and then as a regular. They are the singular non-combatant of the company, taking an advisory role amongst a wide variety of subjects.

They are a keen reader and a very adept chess player (though someone has to move the pieces for them), and can often be found in the library studying up to three separate tomes arranged about their device in a special gantry, in the laboratory verbally assisting in experiments and reagent preparation, or in the mess hall performing comedic oration for the crew.

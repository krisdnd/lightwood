### Background
Lightwood Company, Veteran (joined 1488 DR)

DOB: unknown

(he/him)



Marrak bears a great number of burns across his body, including half his scalp giving him a very one-sided mohawk. A barbarian of indeterminate origins, Marrak uses less individual words than his company colleague Hairless Tenday, although he willingly uses them more often. Most are of a four letter nature, and not pleasant for biographical notation.

Marrak is, if it could be personified as a living breathing individual, violence. He wields a pair of jagged axes with what appears to be reckless abandon, but is in truth a very precise display of martial prowess. In combat his axes frequently come within a hairs breadth of the exposed weak points of his colleagues, as though he is taunting them that with little effort at all he could redirect his rage and tear them limb from limb.

As he has yet to do so, and has remained a loyal member of the company since joining, Marrak has served in more Lightwood missions than any other individual member over time. He rarely takes time away from active duty, only twice while Lightwood was a ground based company (and without explanation, which resulted in forfeiture of several weeks pay), and not once since the company moved to Wildspace operations. 

Company leadership has learned fast to keep an eye on where Marrak is and what he is doing, as he is prone to outbursts of anger, not limited to violence against inanimate objects, aggression directed at strangers in port, and occasional (though never lasting) self harm. Recently he was seen staring out the window of the mess as though mesmerised, before his hand snatched a large knife from a colleagues plate and plunged it into his own thigh unflinchingly.

Most of Marrak’s oldest scars are ritualistic in nature, including the geometric design that runs from above his left eye all the way down his back to end at his left leg. His more recent scars have only come from acid or fire (the latter of which he has a strong aversion to, if not outright phobia of), as he shows an unnatural healing ability for a human. Only once was he challenged on his healing ability, during a Lightwood Company House dinner, which resulted in Henry forcibly removing a large steak knife from Marraks hand, another company members hand, and the table underneath. The point was certainly ‘driven home’.

Marrak can be found shipboard in the gym, in the mess, or sparring on the main deck. He actively avoids anywhere with a lit fire.

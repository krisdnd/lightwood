### Background
Dread Pirate Captain Flurb
The Gentlethem’s Scissors (Galleon, 40 Ton Destroyer)
DOB Unknown
(they/them)

The tiefling known as Flurb has known to make port at Blackrock on occasion, although they have not docked at the station in several years. Host of hedonistic orgies of sexual and consumable overindulgence, they claim to have bedded half of the Dread Pirate Captains known to ply local space lanes.

From a poverty stricken youth on the streets, to a sorcerors lustful apprentice, to skilled courtesan bedding dozens of Faerunian nobles, Flurb became a captain when they won The Gentlethem’s Scissors in a game of cards more than ten years ago. Since then they have been known for smuggling, bounty hunting, occasional mercenary work, and the rare dry land adventure, and eventually caught Blackjammer’s attention and became one of the Dread Pirate Captains of Blackrock.

Flurbs crew is mostly humanoids, all remarkably attractive specimens of their species, and all known to attend their captain ‘on the late shift’. Flurbs tastes run as expensive for material and consumable goods as they do for the lay, and they have been known to provide advice and assistance on occasion for particularly worthy booty (of any interpretation of the word).

In battle, Flurb is a chaotic whirlwind of swashbuckling prowess, punctuated with shouts of ‘Fwoosh!’ as their trademark danger-close fireballs send enemies and allies reeling alike. They’re always the first to kick in a door (often after they’ve picked it), to draw firearm or blade, or to leap up on a table and scream ‘let’s fuckin go then!’.

Chaos given form, and libido.

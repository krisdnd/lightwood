(they/them)





Like their sibling Hank, the illithid known as Frank was actually a timeless quasi-physical being of the mindscape that possessed their host body in order to survive the destruction of the crystal spheres around a hundred years ago.

Shortly after the crash off the coast of Chult, Frank placed the remaining thralls of the vessels crew into a form of psionic stasis, wanting to prioritise the repair of the ship (and in particular the brig) in case they were unable to repair the thralls minds with psychic surgery. Unfortunately the growing thanergic energies of Acereraks’ machine, the soulmonger, triggered the early release of the thralls, who quickly escaped to wander Chult in a frenzied rampage.

The Lightwood Company met Frank after defeating several attacking Pterafolk, who had captured Frank in the jungle of Chult and were planning to eat them. Frank had recently completed their repairs on the octopus ship that had brought them to Chult, although without a working helm they were unable to retrieve it from its sunken crash site, and they had been investigating the island having detected the presence of their sibling Hank.

Frank, like Hank, used a perception filter to alter their image to those around them, and to appear as though they were speaking vocally rather than telepathically. Since their apparent death in Hrakhamar the remnants of the filter have slowly broken down in the minds of the Lightwood Company, and they are beginning to remember Frank distinctly scarier and more moist than the kind, soft spoken human they had assumed them to be.

Sadly, Frank’s hold on their illithid host was partially disrupted by a combination of Acereraks’ thanergic energies and their own proximity to their sibling, Hank, who was broadcasting their physical pain psychically. This overwhelmed them with emotions and caused their risky behaviour above the lava flows of Hrakhamar, where they fell to their apparent death.

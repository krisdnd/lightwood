### Background
Lightwood Company, Founder and Veteran (joined 1479 DR, deceased 1491 DR)

DOB: Midwinter, 1390 DR

(he/him)




Slain by frost giants in 1491 DR, Flegha was one of the Rageface twins that originally helped Henry Lightwood found the company. A sorcerer who enjoyed sizzling his enemies with lightning magic, he was an identical twin of his brother Durin, and the two often used this for their own amusement.

One the battlefield Flegha intentionally dressed identically to his brother Durin, as to confuse any potential enemies on which brother was which. Although he was a spellcaster he lead from the front of the field similar to Durin, his favoured tactic to rush up to clumps of enemies and lightning bolt them with a swipe of his spell focus - a two handed sword, also the twin of Durin’s blade.

Since Flegha’s passing his sword hung on display in the Lightwood Company House. Since the house’s destruction Durin has carried the sword on his back, a daily reminder of the loss of his dear brother. With the company now settled aboard the ship, the sword has been hung on display in the mess hall.

### Background


DOB: Unknown

(he/him)




The bright red parrot known as Crackers appeared somehow in Guardian’s Bag of Holding while the Lightwood Company explored Chult, investigating the death curse. None of the company have been able to deduce how, why, or for how long Crackers was in the extradimensional space, but he seems none the worse for it.

Crackers took to Guardian quickly, and is always seen nearby Guardian, or on the warforged’s shoulder. He watches everything with eyes that suggest a greater intelligence than one might expect for a random, possibly inter-dimensional, parrot.

Crackers occasionally provides commentary or pronounces judgement on witnessed events.
When speaking, he has a rough but loud voice, curses often, and begins every sentence with a loud ‘SKWAWK’ and a flap of his wings. Frequent phrases are ‘SKWAK, FUCK!’ (including ‘FUCK THIS’, ‘FUCK THAT’, and ‘FUCK OFF’), and ‘SKWAWK, NOPE, IM OUT!’. He’s also been known to make scoffing sounds and roll his eyes at others.

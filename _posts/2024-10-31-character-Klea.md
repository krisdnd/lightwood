Tiefling Courtesan

DOB: unknown

(she/her)




A pale skinned tiefling, Klea was found in the Fane of the Night Serpent by the Lightwood company.

Keeping the company of Ras Nsi, she used her natural charisma and wit to stay safe from the predatory nature of the yuan-ti cult, and lived extremely comfortably.

Once Ras Nsi was slain, Klea knew her days of safety in the fane were numbered,and she joined the Lightwood camp as a follower, before becoming crew aboard The Destiny.

Aboard ship she can often be found in the lower officers lounge or crew mess, although her presence in the former is not strictly permitted she seems to ‘fit in well’ there. She also frequents the common areas like the lounges, draped provocatively across a cushioned chair and reading or listening to music performed by others.

She is vegetarian, keeps herself well dressed and in make-up at all times, and is rarely seen sleeping in the crew quarters, leaving many crew members to speculate.

During ship combat she crews as hard as anyone, although she avoids and damage to her person or belongings as best possible.
